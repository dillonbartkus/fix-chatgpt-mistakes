This repo contains all of the changes that I would have made for the server file that chatGPT generated.\
For my reasoning behind the changes, please see the fork of the example file:\
https://gist.github.com/dillonbartkus/e54d34b56c3be1d5becaf6ff8eb3ede3 \
\
This repo is intended to be more prescriptive more than descriptive, or it is intended to be a sort of \
proof of concept, not actually working as written but more so to guide the eng who submitted the PR \
on how to improve their code. I did implement the file structure change I suggested, as well as some syntax changes, \
but time-intensive things like adding auth, validating data, etc are just suggested in the form of TODO comments. \
\
If this were a real code review, it should be the responsibility of the eng to incorporate feedback, \
although I would try and help them as much as possible by providing documentation, \
pointing to similar examples in the codebase, and explaining how / why changes \
should be made. \
\
I like to try to understand what the dev is thinking, so I can better understand \
why they took the approach they did and better offer guidance and suggestions. I feel that a \
good code review is conversational, a good chance to learn new technical skills \
concepts, and I don't like to force changes unless I think there is a good reason for them.
